*I believe that I can be an asset to your company because I have shown that I have an understanding of the basic skills of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I have a passion for programming which I have demonstrated through years of self-study and working on difficult problems with smart people is what motivates me above all else. I also have a teachable attitude and a desire to learn (as evidenced by my continued self-study).*
